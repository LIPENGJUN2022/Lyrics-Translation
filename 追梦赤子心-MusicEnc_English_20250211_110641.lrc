[00:15]Where is the world filled with flowers?
[00:21]If it truly exists, I will definitely go there.
[00:28]I want to stand tall on the highest mountain peak.
[00:34]I don't care if it's a cliff or a steep wall.
[00:41]Live with all my might, love with all my heart, even if it's brain and blood spilled.
[00:47]I don't seek anyone's approval, only that I am true to myself.
[00:55]As for ideals, I have never chosen to give up.
[01:00]Even on days when I'm dusty and grimy.
[01:07]Maybe I don't have talent.
[01:10]But I have the innocence of a dream.
[01:14]I will prove it with my entire life.
[01:20]Maybe I'm not very skilled with my hands.
[01:24]But I am willing to keep searching.
[01:27]Devoting all my youth without regrets.
[01:34]Run forward, facing cold eyes and jeers.
[01:40]The vastness of life can only be felt through hardships.
[01:47]Fate cannot make us beg for mercy.
[01:54]Even if blood spills over my arms.
[02:01]Keep running, with the pride of a child at heart.
[02:07]The brilliance of life cannot be seen without perseverance.
[02:14]Rather than just existing, it's better to burn with passion.
[02:22]One day it will bloom again.
[02:55]The charming and splendid future always calls to me.
[03:01]Even if pain is my companion, I will go forward bravely.
[03:08]I want to sail the deepest blue sea there.
[03:14]Never caring if I can return or not.
[03:20]Feeling despondent after failure.
[03:24]That is the sign of a coward.
[03:27]As long as there is a breath left, please hold tight your fists.
[03:34]Before the dawn breaks.
[03:37]We must be braver.
[03:40]Waiting for the brightest moment when the sun rises.
[03:47]Run forward, facing cold eyes and jeers.
[03:53]The vastness of life can only be felt through hardships.
[04:00]Fate cannot make us beg for mercy.
[04:07]Even if blood spills over my arms.
[04:14]Keep running, with the pride of a child at heart.
[04:20]The brilliance of life cannot be seen without perseverance.
[04:27]Rather than just existing, it's better to burn with passion.
[04:35]For the beauty in my heart.
[04:42]I will not compromise until I am old.
